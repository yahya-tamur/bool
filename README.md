I wrote this for an undergrad senior thesis at UCSC, in Winter 2023.
I've copied the abstract below. The references for the paper are at the end.

Boolean algebras are initially defined as rings where $x^2 = x$ or partial
orders with certain properties. We then define the notions of filters and
ideals, and show the bijection between maximal ideals, ultrafilters, and
homomorphisms into {0,1} from a Boolean algebra. These form the elements
of the so called Stone space of a Boolean algebra. We then introduce the
notion of Boolean topological spaces, and classify Boolean algebras and
Boolean topological spaces in terms of each other. We conclude by showing a
bijection between homomorphisms of Boolean algebras and continuous functions
between their Boolean topological spaces, forming an equivalence of
categories. This result is known as Stone's representation theorem, and
while not explored here, can be extended to a more general result known as
Stone duality.
